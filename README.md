[Wasabi Calendar](http://wasabicalendar.com/)
A collaborative web calendar that also supports availability input of members. 

## Description
The project wasabi calendar aims to create a team scheduling tool that assists organizations of users to organize shared events with the following pages.

### OAuth registration & login
Users can choose a Google account or create a new Google account to register and login to the website

### Home page
After logging in, users will be directed to a gallery view of owned calendars and shared calendars. In this page, they can access any calendars listed or create new calendars. They can always use the button on the right up corner to go back to this page and use the dropdown box to find their username and logout.

### Calendar Page
In a calendar, the owner can invite members to current calendar. The members in the calendar can create new tasks, flip task blocks to view full task information and modify task. They can create tags which will randomly generate colors to categorize the tasks and print the schedule of the current week. They can also mark available time slots and view othersâ€™ availabilities just like in when2meet.

### Create and Modify Task Page
In this page, the users can input topic, tag, description, location, link, task date, start time, and end time to create/modify a task, or go back to previous page without making any changes. They can also delete a task in the modify task page.
